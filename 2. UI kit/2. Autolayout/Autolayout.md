   # Autolayout

## Description
Autolayout is a powerful system used in iOS app development that allows developers to create adaptive and responsive user interfaces. By leveraging constraints, developers can ensure that their app's UI adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes, orientations, and devices. This topic will focus on how to implement Autolayout programmatically using Swift, without the use of Interface Builder.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the principles of Autolayout.
- Learn how to apply constraints programmatically.
- Gain proficiency in creating adaptive layouts using Swift.

**Answer:** *To ensure a button stays horizontally centered in a view programmatically, you can set its translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints property to false and then add a constraint that centers it along the X-axis of its superview. For example:*
```swift
let button = UIButton()
button.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
view.addSubview(button)
NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
    button.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor),
